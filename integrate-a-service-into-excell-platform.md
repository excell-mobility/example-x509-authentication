Integrate a service into the ExCELL platform
============================================
## What is this all about ?
The ExCELL platform provides passwordless authentication for registered services and
 clients to allow a high level of security by implementing a way to enable them to 
 enforce know-your-customer guidelines. This is done via extensive use of asymmetric
 encryption, like SSL client certificates and signed JSON Web Tokens. The idea is to
 allow services to easily verify claims in a secure, standardized way. The implementation
 overhead is minimal, because the SSL client certificate verification is done by the
 web server software (e.g. Apache webserver), while JSON Web Token are validated using
 existing Open Source Libraries for multiple languages.
