Create certificate signing request (CSR) and signed certificate files
=====================================================================
## What is this all about ?
This short document describes how to create a CSR (certificate signing request)
and the related certificate files, signed by the Intermediate CA, in 3 easy steps,
using the scripts from the ZendExpressiveRestX509TestApplication. These scripts are
using OpenSSL to do the magic, so check that OpenSSL is installed in a more or less
current version. 

## Step 1: Create Root- and Intermediate CA certificate files

## Step 2: Generate client key pair and certificate signing request (CSR)

## Step 3: Sign CSR and create client certificate files
